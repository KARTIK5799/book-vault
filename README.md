## 🛠️ Backend Roadmap (Planned)

Currently, BookVault uses a **mock backend** (`json-server`).
I am planning to build a **separate production-ready backend** using:

* **Node.js + Express.js**

  * REST APIs for books, users, and reports
  * CRUD operations with proper validations
* **MongoDB (Mongoose ORM)**

  * Store book records, genres, user data, and borrow history
* **Authentication & Authorization**

  * JWT-based login system
  * Role-based access (Admin, User)
* **Advanced Features**

  * Book issue/return tracking
  * Reports generation (daily/weekly stats)
  * API rate limiting & error handling
* **Deployment**

  * Hosted on **Render / Railway / AWS / Vercel (Serverless)**

This will allow BookVault to move from a demo project → to a **full-stack application** 🚀.

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

* ✅ Authentication & User Roles
* ✅ Add/Edit/Delete books with API
* ✅ Report Charts using Recharts / Chart.js
* ✅ Dark Mode 🌙
* ✅ Export reports (CSV, PDF)
